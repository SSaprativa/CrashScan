# Car Damage Detection using CNN & Transfer Learning (ResNet)

## Introduction
This project focuses on **automated car damage detection** using deep learning. It leverages a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with transfer learning (ResNet)** to analyze images of vehicles, identify damaged areas, and classify the severity of the damage. The model achieved an accuracy of **80%** and is deployed as a **Streamlit web app** for real-time image analysis.

## Modules Used
The following libraries and frameworks were used in this project:

- **Pytorch** – For building and training the CNN model with ResNet transfer learning.
- **NumPy & Pandas** – For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – For data visualization.
- **Streamlit** – For deploying the web application.
- **scikit-learn** – For model evaluation and performance metrics.

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-link.git
   cd car-damage-detection
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Results
- Achieved **80% accuracy** on test data.
- Optimized the model to reduce inference time by **30%**.
- Successfully deployed as a **Streamlit web app** for real-time analysis.

## Future Improvements
- Improve dataset size and quality for better generalization.
- Implement **object detection** to pinpoint damage locations.
- Integrate the model into a **mobile application** for on-the-go analysis.
